1-Download and Install XAMPP or another Web Server:

Download and install XAMPP or any other web server like Apache or Nginx.
Start the web server after installation.

2-Move Files to htdocs Directory:

Navigate to the installation directory of your web server (usually in C:\xampp if you're using XAMPP).
Look for a folder named "htdocs" or "www" and move your project files into this folder. This folder is the default location for web files in web servers.

3-Create the Database:

Open your database management tool (like phpMyAdmin if you're using XAMPP).
Create a new database with the name "forum" or any preferred name for your project.

4-Run the Project:

Open your web browser and type localhost in the address bar.
To access your project, use the address localhost/nome-of-your-folder/welcome.html, where "nome-of-your-folder" is the name of the folder where you moved your project files.
By following these steps, you should be able to see your project's start page (welcome.html) on your web browser when you access localhost/nome-of-your-folder/welcome.html.
